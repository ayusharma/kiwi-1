### Kiwi - Annotation Tool
* * *
OncoBlocks is a new open-source initiative, currently hosted at the Biostatistics and Computational Biology Department of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston, MA. The goal of the project is to create reusable, open source software components to support cancer genomics research and enable precision (or "personalized") cancer medicine. These components can then be used and re-used in multiple research and clinical application contexts, and may also form the basis of new features within the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal (http://www.cbioportal.org/), another open-source project, originally created at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
